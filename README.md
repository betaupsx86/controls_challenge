# Tiny Env
Checkout the tiny env and train your RL agent on the comma challenge.

State
----
| ID | Observation | Min | Max | Units |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | roll lateral acceleration | -5  |  5 |  m/s2 | 
| 1 | forward velocity |  -inf |  inf |  m/s |
| 2 | forward acceleration |  -inf |  inf |  m/s | 
| 3 | target lateral acceleration | -5 |  5 |  m/s2 | 
| 4 | current lateral acceleration | -5 |  5 |  m/s2 |

Action
----
The action is a ndarray with shape (1,), representing the steer torque applied. Clipped from -2 to 2.
You can also try to train your agent to predict a PID controller parameters by passing on_pid to the env.

Reward
----
The negative of the cost as stated in the challenge.

# Comma Controls Challenge!
![Car](./imgs/car.jpg)

Machine learning models can drive cars, paint beautiful pictures and write passable rap. But they famously suck at doing low level controls. Your goal is to write a good controller. This repo contains a model that simulates the lateral movement of a car, given steering commands. The goal is to drive this "car" well for a given desired trajectory.


## Geting Started
We'll be using a synthetic dataset based on the [comma-steering-control](https://github.com/commaai/comma-steering-control) dataset for this challenge. These are actual routes with actual car and road states.

```
# download necessary dataset (~0.6G)
bash ./download_dataset.sh

# install required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt

# test this works
python tinyphysics.py --model_path ./models/tinyphysics.onnx --data_path ./data/00000.csv --debug --controller simple
```

There are some other scripts to help you get aggregate metrics: 
```
# batch Metrics of a controller on lots of routes
python tinyphysics.py --model_path ./models/tinyphysics.onnx --data_path ./data --num_segs 100 --controller simple

# generate a report comparing two controllers
python eval.py --model_path ./models/tinyphysics.onnx --data_path ./data --num_segs 100 --test_controller simple --baseline_controller open

```
You can also use the notebook at [`experiment.ipynb`](https://github.com/commaai/controls_challenge/blob/master/experiment.ipynb) for exploration.

## TinyPhysics
This is a "simulated car" that has been trained to mimic a very simple physics model (bicycle model) based simulator, given realistic driving noise. It is an autoregressive model similar to [ML Controls Sim](https://blog.comma.ai/096release/#ml-controls-sim) in architecture. It's inputs are the car velocity (`v_ego`), forward acceleration (`a_ego`), lateral acceleration due to road roll (`road_lataccel`), current car lateral acceleration (`current_lataccel`) and a steer input (`steer_action`) and predicts the resultant lateral acceleration fo the car.


## Controllers
Your controller should implement an [update function](https://github.com/commaai/controls_challenge/blob/1a25ee200f5466cb7dc1ab0bf6b7d0c67a2481db/controllers.py#L2) that returns the `steer_action`. This controller is then run in-loop, in the simulator to autoregressively predict the car's response.


## Evaluation
Each rollout will result in 2 costs:
- `lataccel_cost`: $\dfrac{\Sigma(actual\\_lat\\_accel - target\\_lat\\_accel)^2}{steps} * 100$

- `jerk_cost`: $\dfrac{\Sigma((actual\\_lat\\_accel\_t - actual\\_lat\\_accel\_{t-1}) / \Delta t)^2}{steps - 1} * 100$

It is important to minimize both costs. `total_cost`: $(lataccel\\_cost *5) + jerk\\_cost$

## Submission
Run the following command, and send us a link to your fork of this repo, and the `report.html` this script generates.
```
python eval.py --model_path ./models/tinyphysics.onnx --data_path ./data --num_segs 5000 --test_controller <insert your controller name> --baseline_controller simple
```
